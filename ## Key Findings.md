\## Key Findings

* A clear seasonal temperature pattern is observed, with temperatures rising steadily from January and peaking during June–August, followed by a decline towards the winter months.



* Relative humidity decreases during summer and increases again during October–November, indicating seasonal atmospheric changes that influence pollutant dispersion.



* Absolute humidity closely follows temperature trends, reaching its highest levels during mid-year and reducing during winter, showing a strong correlation with temperature.



* Air pollution levels are significantly higher during winter months, particularly for Nitrogen Oxides and Nitrogen Dioxide, likely due to reduced dispersion and increased emissions.



* Nitrogen Oxides contribute nearly half (~50%) of total pollution, making them the primary contributors to air quality degradation in Beijing.



* Non-Methane Hydrocarbons and Nitrogen Dioxide also contribute substantially to overall pollution, highlighting the impact of vehicular and industrial emissions.



* Carbon Monoxide shows moderate but consistent presence across months, indicating ongoing combustion-related pollution sources.



* Benzene contributes a smaller percentage, but its presence remains important due to its toxic nature, emphasising the need for monitoring even low-concentration pollutants.



* Year-over-year sensor comparison (2004 vs 2005) shows noticeable variation in pollutant levels, suggesting changing emission patterns and environmental conditions over time.



* The dashboard demonstrates that weather conditions such as temperature and humidity strongly influence air quality, reinforcing the importance of considering environmental factors in pollution analysis.
